# Project 4 Documentation


## 1. Instruction


**Compile and Run**


In the list of files and directories, you should see the following java files:
```
FileMananger.java
Filtering.java
LogIn.java
MarketUser.java
MetricManager.java
User.java (interface)
UserNotFoundException.java(Exception class)
```
Compile all the above files and run the LogIn.java file to run the program. From there you can log in, create new accounts, add stores if you are sellers and access all the user interaction options(message, block/unblock, become invisible, search, view statistics, etc...). If you exit the program without using the program's exit option, your changes will not be saved.


**Files and Directories**


You should also see directories which are used by the program to store all related data
```
data
>buyers
>sellers

users
```
Editing these data files and directories without running the program will likely result in unexpected behavior when running the program again. Please do not try to modify the files.
