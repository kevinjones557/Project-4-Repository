 - Sellers credential file: Username \n StoreName \n Password

 - statistics.txt contains a list of usernames and their number of messages sent to the store followed by words and their frequencies.

+Sellers can create multiple stores.
+
+LogIn: Must prompt for username, email, and password. If it is a seller, give them the option to add stores (as many as they want) any additional log in they can add stores
+They must be able to change this info at any time
+
+Seller can add stores at any time, can't get rid of stores
+
+create a file under data/(buyers or sellers)/(username)/credentials to store email, username, and password
+
+for sellers create a master file that has
+Store1 : Seller1
+Store2 : Seller1
+Store3 : Seller2
+Store4 : Seller3
+Store5 : Seller3
+
+all messaging will still be done through <buyername><sellername>.txt no direct communication through stores, just through seller
+
+HUGE PROBLEM IF WE LET THEM EDIT USERNAME
+
+In Menu:
+Customers see a list of stores, then go throuhg file and find seller
+Customeres also search for seller username directly
